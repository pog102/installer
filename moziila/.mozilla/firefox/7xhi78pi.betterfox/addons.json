These colors can then be used to style your terminal, window manager, etc. This add-on will take those same colors and automatically create a Firefox theme with them, using the Firefox Theme API (no CSS). This allows for dynamic theming, without the need of a restart.\n\nThe reason that you need to install a script on your computer is because Firefox has no way of getting the colors generated by Pywal natively. Generated colors are stored in a file on your computer and the script handles the communication with your browser.\n\nThe colors used for the theme can be customized, either by selecting a color from your Pywal colors or by choosing a custom color using the colorpicker.\n\nIf you are using DuckDuckGo, the add-on has an option to automatically change the colors of DuckDuckGo to match your browser theme.\n\nThere is also an included CSS file that can be enabled. The CSS will style dropdown- and context menus, add bold text and more.\n\nYou can submit issues/bugs here: https://github.com/frewacom/pywalfox/issues","weeklyDownloads":40,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Fredrik Engstrand","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13322493/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274151.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274151.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274152.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274152.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274153.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274153.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274154.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274154.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274155.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274155.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274156.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274156.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274157.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274157.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274158.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274158.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274159.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274159.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274160.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274160.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7,"reviewCount":3,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/reviews/","updateDate":1674567917000}]}
