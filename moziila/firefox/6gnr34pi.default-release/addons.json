These colors can then be used to style your terminal, window manager, etc. This add-on will take those same colors and automatically create a Firefox theme with them, using the Firefox Theme API (no CSS). This allows for dynamic theming, without the need of a restart.\n\nThe reason that you need to install a script on your computer is because Firefox has no way of getting the colors generated by Pywal natively. Generated colors are stored in a file on your computer and the script handles the communication with your browser.\n\nThe colors used for the theme can be customized, either by selecting a color from your Pywal colors or by choosing a custom color using the colorpicker.\n\nIf you are using DuckDuckGo, the add-on has an option to automatically change the colors of DuckDuckGo to match your browser theme.\n\nThere is also an included CSS file that can be enabled. The CSS will style dropdown- and context menus, add bold text and more.\n\nYou can submit issues/bugs here: https://github.com/frewacom/pywalfox/issues","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274151.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274151.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274152.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274152.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274153.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274153.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274154.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274154.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274155.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274155.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274156.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274156.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274157.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274157.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274158.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274158.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274159.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274159.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274160.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274160.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/frewacom/Pywalfox","supportURL":"https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7,"reviewCount":3,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":30,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4016698/pywalfox-2.0.9.xpi","updateDate":1665999013000},{"id":"{74145f27-f039-47ce-a470-a662b129930a}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-32.png?modified=b06fa7ed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-64.png?modified=b06fa7ed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-128.png?modified=b06fa7ed"},"name":"ClearURLs","version":"1.26.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4032442/clearurls-1.26.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://clearurls.xyz/","supportURL":"http://wiki.clearurls.xyz","description":"Removes tracking elements from URLs","fullDescription":"This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.\n\nMany websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale) to mark your online activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

There is no way to prevent this without this permission.\n\n- access browser tabs\n\nThe permission to access the browser tabs is needed so that New Tab Override can jump to the settings page if it’s already open in another tab when you click the button to open the extension’s settings.\n\n- read and modify browser settings\n\nThe permission to read and modify browser settings is needed to change the position of new tabs and for the option to automatically use your home page as new tab page.\n\nOptional permissions. These permissions are not needed to install and use New Tab Override:\n\n- access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at\n\nThe permission to access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at is only needed if you enable the option to see the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page. If enabled, New Tab Override reads the feed of www.soeren-hentzschel.at to show you the latest news.\n\nSilent permissions. New Tab Override requires additional permissions, but Firefox does not prompt requests for the following:\n\n- menus\n\nThe menus permission is needed for providing an entry in the tools menu for accessing New Tab Override's settings.\n\n- storage\n\nThe storage permission is needed so that New Tab Override can store settings such as your new tab page.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe extension requires at least Firefox 78.
