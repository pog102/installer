These colors can then be used to style your terminal, window manager, etc. This add-on will take those same colors and automatically create a Firefox theme with them, using the Firefox Theme API (no CSS). This allows for dynamic theming, without the need of a restart.\n\nThe reason that you need to install a script on your computer is because Firefox has no way of getting the colors generated by Pywal natively. Generated colors are stored in a file on your computer and the script handles the communication with your browser.\n\nThe colors used for the theme can be customized, either by selecting a color from your Pywal colors or by choosing a custom color using the colorpicker.\n\nIf you are using DuckDuckGo, the add-on has an option to automatically change the colors of DuckDuckGo to match your browser theme.\n\nThere is also an included CSS file that can be enabled. The CSS will style dropdown- and context menus, add bold text and more.\n\nYou can submit issues/bugs here: https://github.com/frewacom/pywalfox/issues","weeklyDownloads":39,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Fredrik Engstrand","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13322493/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238390.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238390.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Dark mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238391.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238391.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Light mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238392.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238392.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Light mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238393.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238393.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Dark mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238394.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238394.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238395.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238395.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Palette templates"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238396.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238396.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Theme templates"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238397.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238397.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"Debugging output"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238398.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238398.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"DuckDuckGo theme"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238399.png?modified=1651301016","width":1400,"height":1040,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/238/238399.jpg?modified=1651301016","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":396,"caption":"DuckDuckGo theme"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7,"reviewCount":3,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/reviews/","updateDate":1651301778000}]}
