These warnings appear on most websites until the visitor agrees with the website's terms and conditions. Imagine how irritating that becomes when you surf anonymously or if you delete cookies automatically every time you close the browser.\n\nThis add-on will remove these cookie warnings from almost all websites! You can report any website which still warns you about cookies: just click 'Report a cookie warning' from the extension menu (the brown cookie image next to your address bar).\n\nIn most cases, the add-on just blocks or hides cookie related pop-ups. When it's needed for the website to work properly, it will automatically accept the cookie policy for you (sometimes it will accept all and sometimes only necessary cookie categories, depending on what's easier to do). It doesn't delete cookies.\n\nOther browsers are supported too.

These colors can then be used to style your terminal, window manager, etc. This add-on will take those same colors and automatically create a Firefox theme with them, using the Firefox Theme API (no CSS). This allows for dynamic theming, without the need of a restart.\n\nThe reason that you need to install a script on your computer is because Firefox has no way of getting the colors generated by Pywal natively. Generated colors are stored in a file on your computer and the script handles the communication with your browser.\n\nThe colors used for the theme can be customized, either by selecting a color from your Pywal colors or by choosing a custom color using the colorpicker.\n\nIf you are using DuckDuckGo, the add-on has an option to automatically change the colors of DuckDuckGo to match your browser theme.\n\nThere is also an included CSS file that can be enabled. The CSS will style dropdown- and context menus, add bold text and more.\n\nYou can submit issues/bugs here: https://github.com/frewacom/pywalfox/issues","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274151.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274151.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274152.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274152.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274153.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274153.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274154.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274154.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274155.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274155.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274156.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274156.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274157.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274157.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274158.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274158.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274159.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274159.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274160.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274160.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/frewacom/Pywalfox","supportURL":"https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7,"reviewCount":3,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":30,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4016698/pywalfox-2.0.9.xpi","updateDate":1665999013000},{"id":"{8fbc7259-8015-4172-9af1-20e1edfbbd3a}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/955/955405-32.png?modified=df8870e6","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/955/955405-64.png?modified=df8870e6","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/955/955405-128.png?modified=df8870e6"},"type":"extension","name":"Midnight Lizard","version":"10.7.1","creator":{"name":"Pavel Agarkov","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13894770/"},"developers":[],"description":"Custom color schemes for all websites: night mode, dark themes, blue light filter, screen shader, high contrast, grayscale, etc.","fullDescription":"Midnight Lizard color schemes work across all websites.
